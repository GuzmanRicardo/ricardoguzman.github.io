** Innovation in Agricultural Technology and Rural Development **

For developing countries, protecting the intellectual property (IP) of critical technology represents a clear economic tradeoff. On one hand, IP protection can induce the entry of new technologies and facilitate the transfer of technology from abroad. On the other hand, it can raise prices and distort input choices for firms downstream. I empirically evaluate this tradeoff between innovation and access in the context of a reform that introduced patent protection for seed varieties in Tanzania. I assemble a dataset combining information on registered seed varieties, plant breeders, and variety characteristics from government catalogues, along with extensive plot-level data on agricultural inputs and outputs from a panel of farms. This enables me to estimate the impact of patent-induced innovation in seed varieties on patterns of input acquisition, harvest revenues, and agricultural productivity. To produce credible estimates, I rely on a shift-share design that leverages temporal variation in the entry of new seed varieties and spatial variation in crop suitability. Preliminary results suggest that exposure to new seed varieties, on average, led households to shift from informal to commercial seed sources and boosted revenues from crop sales and crop output per hectare of land.
