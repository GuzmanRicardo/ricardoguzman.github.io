# Welcome!

![Site Image]({{ '/assets/profile.jpeg' | relative_url }}){: style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; width: 200px; height: auto;"}

I am a PhD candidate at the Aix-Marseille School of Economics ([AMSE]).

<p> I work on questions in <strong>economic development</strong> and <strong>agricultural economics</strong> using tools from spatial economics and economic geography. My Job Market Paper studies an expansion of available crop technologies in Tanzania and its implications on adoption and agricultural productivity.  </p>

This spring, I will be visiting the Institute for International Economic Studies ([IIES]) hosted by Tessa Bold and the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences ([SLU]) hosted by Shon Ferguson.

I am always happy to chat. Please feel free to reach out: ricardo.guzman@univ-amu.fr
