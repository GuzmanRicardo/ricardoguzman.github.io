## Welcome! 

I am a PhD candidate at the Aix-Marseille School of Economics ([AMSE]).

<p> I work on questions in <strong>economic development</strong> and <strong>agricultural economics</strong> using tools from spatial economics and economic geography. My Job Market Paper studies an expansion of available crop technologies in Tanzania and its implications on adoption and agricultural productivity. My projects generally combine spatial and survey data. </p>
